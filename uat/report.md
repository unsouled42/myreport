#   TAS 5.0 ‚Äì UAT Test Report

**Environment:** TRIRIGA Application Suite 5.0 ‚Äì UAT  
**Prepared by:** Souleiman Bentouyer  
<!-- {docsify-updated} -->

---

##  Objective

This report presents the outcome of unit testing executed in the **UAT environment** as part of the TAS 5.0 migration project.

It serves as a validation checkpoint between the DEV and PROD environments, with a focus on:

- **Confirming consistency with prior DEV test results**
- **Identifying UAT-specific behaviors or environment differences** 
- **Supporting readiness for go-live**

---

## üß™ Validation Approach

All unit tests from the DEV phase (UT001‚ÄìUT013) were re-executed in the UAT environment to validate functional stability and environment alignment prior to production rollout.

## ‚úÖ Summary of Results

| Test Area                  | Status       | Notes |
|----------------------------|--------------|-------|
| Business Objects & Tables  | ‚úÖ Aligned    | Deployment matches DEV environment |
| Data Ingestion             | ‚úÖ Passed     | Uploads functioned identically via Data Integrator |
| UI Forms & Validation      | ‚úÖ Confirmed  | Field-level rules and auto-fill behaviors validated |
| Lifecycle Transitions      | ‚úÖ Functional | Status changes and system transitions work as expected |
| Reporting & Audit Trail    | ‚úÖ Verified   | Audit fields and report exports consistent and accurate |
| Service Associations       | ‚úÖ Working    | Equipment and food services correctly linked |
| Calendar Integration       | ‚úÖ Corrected  | Reservation entries now visible in the calendar view |
| API Connectivity (OSLC)    | ‚úÖ Revalidated | GET and POST operations successful using UAT endpoints |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

| Test Case | Status | Observation |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| UT008 ‚Äì Invalid Date Ranges | ‚úîÔ∏è Known Issue | The system still allows reversed start/end dates ‚Äî same as DEV |

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This behavior is inherited from pre-migration logic and does not block UAT sign-off. Recommendation: implement BO-level validation rule in a future release.

##  Observations

- System performance noticeably improved compared to earlier cycles ‚Äî page loads and transitions are faster and more responsive  
---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

All critical functional and technical validations for reservation management were successfully reproduced in the UAT environment.

The previously open issue related to calendar visibility (UT007) has been resolved ‚Äî reservation entries now appear correctly in the calendar view.

‚úîÔ∏è **No regressions detected**  
‚úîÔ∏è **Go-live readiness confirmed**
